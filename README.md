# Software Capstone Project

## Welcome to Roland Wildes's capstone project

The software capstone for SNHU's computer science degree looks to take projects created throughout the course and then enhance them using the knowledge gained through the course. 
This aims to exhibit progress and development of skills in three main categories being Software Design/Engineering, Algorithms/Data structures and Databases. The following portfolio contains a code review video created before enhancements, detailed narratives for each section of enhancement including why something was changed and how. Each enhancement can be found in a link below as well as the link for the code review video. 

### Self Assessment
As a mostly self-taught programmer my skills coming into the program were very basic. My programming skills for languages was mainly limited to Java with some use of Python and HTTP/xml which I used often during my time as a FIRST robotics student and then mentor however there were still many languages I hadn't tried. The computer science program has expanded my knowledge on all my previous skills and has taught me many new skills and techniques I use regularly with my programming today. Today I am very comfortable with my main languages as well as C, SQL, and more. I also find it much easier to pick up a new language given my time learning what best strategies work while assignments for the CS courses. 

The following capstone project demonstrates some of the skills I have gained during my time completing classes in this program. For this capstone I needed to chose an artifact or artifacts that I had previously created. I chose my event tracker application as it was one of the more memorable as I used many of the skills I had gained throughout the course and compiled them into this program. I think the resulting artifact that I chose to enhance demonstrates some of the skills that I gained during the courses and demonstrates my abilities to evaluate, plan, develope and test code in a professional and well structured manner. Each enhancement was added with thought put into each category of study for software Design/Engineering, algorithms/data structures and databases. Below are links to the code review, enhancements and the code for both the original and final version of my project.
