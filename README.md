# Roland Wildes - Software Capstone Project

## Welcome to Roland Wildes's capstone project

The software capstone for SNHU's computer science degree looks to take projects created throughout the course and then enhance them using the knowledge gained through the course. 
This aims to exhibit progress and development of skills in three main categories being Software Design/Engineering, Algorithms/Data structures and Databases. The following portfolio contains a code review video created before enhancements, detailed narratives for each section of enhancement including why something was changed and how. Each enhancement can be found in a link below as well as the link for the code review video. 

### Self Assessment
During my time completing classes in this program, I have learned a lot about computer sciences and programming as I have created project and programs during many of the courses. The main three concepts and skills I have learned are programming fundamentals, programming languages, and critical thinking regarding planning and developing strategies for completing tasks. 

As a mostly self-taught programmer my skills coming into the program were very basic. My programming skills for languages was mainly limited to Java with some use of Python and HTTP/xml but very limited overall. The program has expanded my knowledge on all my previous skills and has taught me many new skills and techniques I use regularly with my programming today. 


For this project I chose to enhance one of my most recent programs in the course as I felt that it was still missing some vital pieces. The program met all of the requirements for the course I was doing at the time however the end result needed some more functionality and polishing in order to make it a finished product. I believe after the enhancements it is a much more functional and user friendly product and allowed me to demonstrate my knowledge that I gained throughout the computer science course.
