# Roland Wildes - Software Capstone Project

## Welcome to Roland Wildes's capstone project

The software capstone for SNHU's computer science degree looks to take projects created throughout the course and then enhance them using the knowledge gained through the course. 
This aims to exhibit progress and development of skills in three main categories being Software Design/Engineering, Algorithms/Data structures and Databases. The following portfolio contains a code review video created before enhancements, detailed narratives for each section of enhancement including why something was changed and how. Each enhancement can be found in a link below as well as the link for the code review video.
