## Software Design and Engineering Enhancement

### Overview

After outlining my planed changes and upgrades in , I set to implementing the changes. First, I worked on the software/design side where I wanted to rework the UI and make it easier and more intuitive. Originally, I wanted to add a button for delete on the event card however this would make the interface rather crowded. Instead, I have implemented a long click so you can hold down on the event you want and then you are prompted to either edit or delete the event. I also changed the short click to open a view for the event rather than the edit. This allows you to view the details of the event without accidentally making changes.
