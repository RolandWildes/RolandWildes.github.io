# Software Capstone Project

## Software Design and Engineering Enhancement

### Overview

For this project I chose to enhance one of my most recent programs, a event tracking application, that allows a user or multiple users to save events like a calender application. After completing the course where I created my event application I felt that it was still missing some vital pieces. The program met all of the requirements for the course I was doing at the time however the end result needed some more functionality and polishing in order to make it a finished product. I believe after the enhancements it is a much more functional and user friendly product and allowed me to demonstrate my knowledge that I gained throughout the computer science course. 

The application, "Tasky", was supposed to be a bare bones and simple database program where a user could store events to keep track of what they had on their schedule. Overall this was a very good way to learn sql databases as I had a little knowledge before hand however I had never used a database to retrieve saved data and do something like display it with a UI before. 

After going through my [code review](https://rolandwildes.github.io/Code-Review) I then set out to make some changes to my applications design with the goal of making the application more user friendly. Originally as mentioned in my code review, I wanted to add a button for deleting on the event card however this would make the interface rather crowded as each event card is rather small. Instead, I decided to implement a long click so you can hold down on the event you want and then you are prompted to either edit or delete the event. This is similar to what most application use these days some users are used to this sort of control for selecting something. I also changed the short click to open a view for the event rather than the edit. This new short click allows you to view the details of the event without accidentally making changes as previously this would open stright to the editing functionality and you may change the event by mistake.
